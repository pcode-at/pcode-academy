# PCode Academy

## Introduction
In the PCode Academy you can level up your development skills to get an expert in every domain we provide.

## How it works

### Choose a module
The PCode Academy is seperated in different domains. One domain for example could be React. A domain is then again seperated in specific modules like react-beginner or react-redux. 

### Module readme
If you have choosen a module you will find a readme.md in there. The readme.md is seperated in:

* Course
* Comments
* PCode Clean Code Adventure

#### Resources
These are simply links to courses like in the [react beginner module](https://github.com/pcode-at/pcode-academy/blob/react-beginner/react-beginner/readme.md) or links to articles as we did it in this [module](https://github.com/pcode-at/pcode-academy/blob/react-beginner/javascript/asynchronous.md). 

**Important**: Often there are other articles linked in the article we link to in our resources. If we do not explicitly mention that you also need to read the linked article it is not necessary to read them.

#### Comments
After you have watched the course completly you go ahead and read our comments to the course. Here you can find some additions of us, like when we have a different approach than the course intructor or we want to add something.

#### PCode Clean Code Adventure
For some modules we setup a piece of code with unit tests. It is not a test like in the school but it should help you to understand the module you want to learn better. It is more like an entry point into a discussion because you fulfill the tests and then you will make a pull request to our [repository](https://github.com/pcode-at/clean-code-adventure). Then we discuss together your code in form of a code review.
