# PCode Academy

## Introduction
In the PCode Academy you can level up your development skills to become an expert in every domain we provide.

## How it works

### Choose a module
The PCode Academy is seperated in different domains. One domain for example could be React. A domain is then again seperated in specific modules like react-beginner or react-redux. 

### Module readme
If you have chosen a module, you will find a readme.md in there. The readme.md is seperated in:

* Resources
* Comments
* PCode Clean Code Adventure

#### Resources
These are simply links to courses, just like in the [react beginner module](https://github.com/pcode-at/pcode-academy/blob/react-beginner/react-beginner/readme.md) or links to articles, as we did in [asynchronous module](https://github.com/pcode-at/pcode-academy/blob/react-beginner/javascript/asynchronous.md). 

**Important**: Often there are other articles linked in the article we link to in our resources. If we do not explicitly mention that you also need to read the linked article it is not necessary to read them.

#### Comments
After you have watched the course completly, go ahead and read our comments on the course. There you can find some additions from us, like a different approach than the course intructor, which we use in our company, or just some words on the topic we wanted to throw in. 

#### PCode Clean Code Adventure
For some modules we setup a piece of code with unit tests. It is not a test like in school but it should help you understand the module you want to learn better. It is more like an entry point into a discussion, because you will fulfill the tests and then make a pull request to our [clean-code-adventure](https://github.com/pcode-at/clean-code-adventure). Afterwards we discuss your code in form of a code review together.
