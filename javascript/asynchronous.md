# Asynchronous code
JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. Considering this it is very important that you understand the behavior of asynchronous code.
There are three important techniques for writing asynchronous code in JavaScript:
* Callbacks
* Promises
* Async / Await


## Resources
For understanding asynchronous JavaScript in general read this [article](https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-asynchronous-javascript-the-event-loop-74cd408419ff).

### Callbacks
A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing. Read this [article](https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced).

### Promises
For understanding promises read this [article](https://codeburst.io/a-simple-guide-to-es6-promises-d71bacd2e13a). For more information about promises and good practices read this [article](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261). It is important that you know the prototype methods `.then`, `.catch` and the functions available from Promise: `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`.

### Async / Await
This [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/avoiding-the-async-await-hell-c77a0fb71c4c) points out the correct usage of async/await and how you can avoid common pitfalls.
